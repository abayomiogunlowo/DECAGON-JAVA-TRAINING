Hi Deborah,

I hope this email finds you well.

Please find below my retrospectives for Week 7 on the program:

Stop Doing: I don't have any suggestions for things that should be stopped at this time.
Continue Doing: Maintaining the Educational Tech standard in the industry.
Start Doing: Implement a dedicated social media team to promote Decadevs, particularly on Decagon's social platforms. Having discussed this with several other developers, we believe it would be beneficial to have around 10 story-like posts on Decagon's socials that showcase our journey throughout the program. This initiative could significantly enhance the visibility of Decagon Institute and its developers, attracting potential students and partners while highlighting the vibrant community and the high-quality training we receive.
Challenges: Continuous issues with water supply in the apartment.
Recommendations: No recommendations at this time.
Thank you for considering my feedback. I look forward to contributing to the continuous improvement of our program.

Best regards,

Abayomi Ogunlowo
