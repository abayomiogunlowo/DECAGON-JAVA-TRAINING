Hi Deborah,
I hope this email finds you well.
Please find below my retrospectives for Week 6 on the program:
Stop Doing: I don't have any suggestions for things that should be stopped at this time.
Continue Doing: Despite the rumors about our squad being the last in-person batch, I believe the program should continue offering the in-person bootcamp alongside online sessions. The opportunity for in-person learning was a significant factor in my decision to join the program.
Start Doing: Spice up the program with things like extra non-educational activities, adding Pizza to our Menu once a month and more. These give the brain some nice dopamine hits you know?  Thank you.
Challenges: Issues with water supply in the apartment and delays in food deliveries.
Recommendations: No recommendations at this time.
Thank you for considering my feedback. I look forward to contributing to the continuous improvement of our program.
Best regards,
Abayomi Ogunlowo
